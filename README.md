# Knowledge-Guided Diffusion Model for 3D Ligand-Pharmacophore Mapping

Official implementation of [Knowledge-Guided Diffusion Model for 3D Ligand-Pharmacophore Mapping](to be published) by Jun-Lin Yu, Cong Zhou, Xiang-Gen Liu, Guo-Bo Li. 
Pharmacophores are abstractions of essential chemical interaction patterns, holding an irreplaceable position in drug discovery. Despite the availability of many pharmacophore-based tools, the adoption of deep learning for pharmacophore-guided drug discovery remains relatively rare. We herein propose a novel knowledge-guided diffusion framework for ‘on-the-fly’ 3D ligand-pharmacophore mapping, named DiffPhore. It comprises a knowledge-guided ligand-pharmacophore mapping encoder, a diffusion conformation generator, and a calibrated conformation sampler. By training on two newly established benchmark datasets of pharmacophore-ligand pairs, DiffPhore achieved state-of-the-art performance in predicting ligand active conformations, surpassing traditional pharmacophore tools and several advanced docking methods. It also manifested superior virtual screening power for both lead discovery and target fishing.

# Installation
## Requirements
DiffPhore is developed on the Rocky Linux 9.2 OS, CUDA 12.1 with Anaconda 23.3.1 and main packages as follows:
- Python 3.9.16
- PyTorch 1.12.1
- PyTorch Geometric 2.1.0.post1
- RDKit 2021.03.1

## Command
You can install these packages via the `environment.yml` file by running the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/VicFisher/DiffPhore.git
cd DiffPhore/src
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate diffphore
```
Note that the pytorch_geometric package installation might be problematic, you can try to install it manually through local `.whl` files.

# Usage
## 1. Calculate pharmacophore files using [AncPhore](https://ancphore.ddtmlab.org/)
Please refer to the [AncPhore](https://ancphore.ddtmlab.org/) website for more details.
Here, we provide a pharmacophore file as an example (`examples/phore/sQC_QFA_complex.phore`), which is the one used for virtual screening of sQC in the paper.

## 2. Run DiffPhore
### Pharmacophore mapping for a single ligand-pharmacophore pair
```
python src/inference.py --phore examples/phore/sQC_QFA_complex.phore --ligand examples/ligands/STK936575.sdf --cache_path data/caches --out_dir examples/output/1 --model_dir weights/diffphore_calibrated_warmuped_ft --sample_per_complex 40 --batch_size 20 --num_workers 6
```
`--phore` option specifies the pharmacophore file generated by AncPhore. <br />
`--ligand` specifies the ligand file in MOL/SDF format (only the first molecule will be used) or a text file contains SMILESs (each line as 'CCCCC xxx').<br />
`--cache_path` specifies the directory for storing the cached dataset of the inputs.<br />
`--out_dir` specifies the output directory. <br />
`--model_dir` specifies the directory containing the DiffPhore model weights.<br />
`--sample_per_complex` specifies the number of samples to be generated for each ligand-pharmacophore pair.<br />
`--inference_steps` specifies the number of denoising steps (default is 20)<br />
`--batch_size` specifies the batch size for the model inference.<br />
`--num_workers` specifies the number of workers for the data loader.<br />
`--fitness` specifies the fitness score to be used for ranking the poses, default is 1 (DfScore1). Options: DfScore1, DfScore2, DfScore3, DfScore4, DfScore5 (specific to target fishing task, or specify `--target_fishing True` instead). This depends on the AncPhore program contained in the `programs` folder.<br />
Other options can be found in the code.<br />
The output directory will contain the pharmacophore mapping results (mapping process, ranked poses and mapping summary files).<br />


### Pharmacophore mapping for multiple ligand-pharmacophore pairs (in the cases of virtual screening or target fishing)
```
python src/inference.py --phore_ligand_csv examples/task_file.csv --cache_path data/caches --out_dir examples/output/2 --model_dir weights/diffphore_calibrated_warmuped_ft --sample_per_complex 40 --batch_size 20 --num_workers 6
```
`--phore_ligand_csv` specifies the csv file containing the ligand and pharmacophore input information. The csv file should contains the header 'ligand_description' and 'phore', which require the same file format as `--ligand` and `--phore` options.<br />
